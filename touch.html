                        <p>
                        The touch event is the mouse event but using your fingers. The touch interface
                        has the user touch at a touchpoint to interact with the device, mostly with tablets
                        and phones. The touch event can do many actions like scrolling up or down and zooming
                        in and out. Although not as well versed like the mouse, it has become very popular
                        and well adjusted.

                        Pointer events are used with tools like the apple pen to replace or enhance the 
                        touch event. It involves using a device to point at an object. It's used to organize
                        the mouse and touch events. You have to apply pressure in order to activate the pointer.
