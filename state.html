                    During a session, which is when a user visits a website, state information
                    is transferred between the client to the server. 
                    The internet use to be statless and only used to read information and 
                    not intereact with people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stateless data does not need to be maintained. The design for stateless 
                    a static design since it does not need to keep any information. Stateless
                    data is easier and efficient because it doesn't have to store information.
                    They are limited because of that face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many different uses to store and maintian state. In the book example, 
                    shopping carts such as Amazon, stores information. Social media would be another
                    example. Forms and sign in's are ones that come to mind becuase they are used a lot
                    to keep passwords, which can be a security problem that is talked about later in the 
                    book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few approaches to maintain state information. It can be store remotely
                    or on the client device. Storing a lot of information on either can strain and slow
                    down the computer or website. So it's best to clear out data when you no longer need 
                    it. JavaScript can be used to help store and delete date for both the client and server
                    side.
